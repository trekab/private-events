# Private Events

> Private events a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.
In this project, I focus on implementing the following features:
A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require me to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names.
